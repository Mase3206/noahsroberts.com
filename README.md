**scssg** (pronounced /ˈskɪsɪg/ <sup>[?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)</sup>) is a **s**uper **c**ustomizable **s**tatic **s**ite **g**enerator. Pages and posts are written in Markdown with Jekyll-style frontmatter for metadata. Site structure is laid out in a single YAML file that automatically updates navigation. 

## Features

- Write in familiar and human-readable Markdown, just like every other static site generator.
- Configurable, automatic navigation menus
- Completely customizable templates and styling using Jinja and Sass
- Global and/or per-page, category, or topic posts

## Why scssg?

- Easy install! (unlike Jekyll)
- Extremely customizable! No hidden theme or template folders, everything is right there in your project folder (unlike Jekyll)

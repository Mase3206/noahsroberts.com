**ssrssg** (pronounced /ˈsɚsɪg/ <sup>[?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)</sup>) is a **s**uper **s**imple, **r**eactive **s**tatic **s**ite **g**enerator. Pages and posts are written in Markdown with Jekyll-style frontmatter for metadata. Site structure is laid out in a single YAML file that automatically updates navigation. 

## Features

- Write in familiar and human-readable Markdown, just like every other static site generator.
- Configurable, automatic navigation menus
- Completely customizable templates and styling using Jinja and Sass
- Minimal yet reactive front-end components using Preact
- Global and/or per-page, category, or topic posts

## Why ssrssg?

- Easy install! (unlike Jekyll)
- No Node.js! Pre-processing uses Python, Preact uses ES with Deno.
- Extremely customizable! No hidden theme or template folders, everything is right there in your project folder (unlike Jekyll)

> [!WARNING]
> **Heads up,** this is a hobby project to teach myself Preact. I can't promise it will work for everyone.

This is the source code to my main website, [noahsroberts.com](https://noahsroberts.com). It's a full recreation of my existing Wordpress site (which is currently still live) entirely in SvelteKit, both as a learning project and a way to save $48 a year.

## Why not another static site generator?

I have tried a few previous SSGs, like Jekyll and Hugo, but they aren't customizeable enough for my needs. Hugo might be, but I didn't end up diving into it much.

I hate Jekyll. It's a piece of unusable garbage that is barely installable in macOS, and even then, the underlying theme(s) are hidden away from you, making it basically impossible to customize. 

So I'm doing it all myself.

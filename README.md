scssg (pronounced /ˈskɪsɪg/ ?) is a super customizable static site generator. Pages and posts are written in Markdown with Jekyll-style frontmatter for metadata. Site structure is laid out in a single YAML file that automatically updates navigation.

> [!WARNING]
> Heads up, this is a hobby project. While it's possible to fork this and make it your own, that's not my intention. It's a place for me to host my site when I eventually (maybe) abandon WordPress. It's also a bit janky.

## Features

- Write in familiar and human-readable Markdown, just like every other static site generator.
- Configurable, automatic navigation menus
- Completely customizable templates and styling using Jinja and Sass
- Global and/or per-page, category, or topic posts

## Why scssg?

- Easy install! (unlike Jekyll)
- Extremely customizable! No hidden theme or template folders, everything is right there in your project folder (unlike Jekyll)
- Because I can.

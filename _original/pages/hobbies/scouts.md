I was a member of Troop 1 from Great Falls, Montana from 2015 to 2022. I served as Patrol Leader for two and a half years and Assistant Senior Patrol Leader for three years.

In September of 2022, I earned the rank of Eagle Scout. My project involved assembling and staining four double trash can holders for Grande Vista Park in Great Falls.

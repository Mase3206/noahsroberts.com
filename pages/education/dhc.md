The [Davidson Honors College](http://dhc.umt.edu/) is located at the University of Montana and is funded in part by community donations. It offers scholarships for undergraduate students, graduate students, and study abroad programs. Many students in the DHC are also members of the [Franke GLI](/education/gli.html), as they attract a similar audience.

The [Franke Global Leadership Initiative](https://www.umt.edu/global-leadership-initiative/) (or just GLI) is a four-year certificate program at the University of Montana that focuses on global issues and challenges that may go unnoticed by the general populous. Students are challenged to address some of these issues through various seminars and a semester abroad, culminating in a Senior Capstone project. Because most GLI students are also in the [DHC](/education/dhc.html), the GLI Senior Capstone is also accepted by the DHC.

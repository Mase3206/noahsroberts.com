A “homelab” is a home server intended for both testing and production for the purpose of entertainment, experimentation, and curiosity. They come in all shapes and sizes: everything from a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) (or [a few](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/raspberry-pi-cluster-episode-1-introduction-clusters)!), an old laptop, or a retired enterprise server from your local university. People often run [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), or a game server for their own and their friends’ use.

I run a homelab myself. Mine consists of four semi-independent computers working together in a symphony of beautiful chaos. I share more details about the specifics of my hardware in [this post](#).

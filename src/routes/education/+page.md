I am a first year student at the University of Montana in Missoula, MT where I am studying Computer Science and German. I am also a member of the [Davidson Honors College](/education/dhc) and the [Franke Global Leadership Initiative](/education/gli). I plan on studying abroad my third year in Germany and hope to wrap it all up in 2027.

I previously graduated from Great Falls College - Montana State University (GFC MSU) with the [MUS Core General Education Certificate](https://mus.edu/transfer/GenEd.html), which proves that I have satisfied the general education requirements for all colleges and universities in the Montana University System. This means that, even though the requirements of University of Montana differ from those of Montana State University or Great Falls College, they are required to accept them.

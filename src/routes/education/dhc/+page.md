The [Davidson Honors College](http://dhc.umt.edu/) is located at the University of Montana and is funded in part by community donations. It offers scholarships for undergraduate students, graduate students, and study abroad programs. Many students in the DHC are also members of the [Franke GLI](/education/gli), as they attract a similar audience.

### What does it mean to be honorable?

This project is a final reflection on the individual honors experience. I read an original poem as part of an auditory experience. It is best experienced with high-quality headphones.

### TOTSME Reflection

TOTSME (Trick Or Treat So Missoula Eats) is an annual tradition held by the DHC. Honors students go door to door and drop off an informational flier asking residents to collect non-perishable food items to donate to the Missoula Food Bank. We then return a week later to pick up the donations and hand them off to the Food Bank.

### *Braiding Sweetgrass* Summative Piece

For this assignment, we were tasked with taking a component of Robin Wall Kimmerer's *Braiding Sweetgrass* and either writing about it or doing something creative ​with it, like an art piece, a video, or a poem. 

I wrote a poem about the values of reciprocity and respect for nature as taught in [Scouts](/hobbies/scouts), to which I dedicated over a decade of my life. The file is attached below.

### Academic Plan

Here, we were tasked with laying out a plan for our college careers in terms of what classes we need to take, when, for what, and making sure all prerequisites are met, as well adding any experiential learning like study abroad. We made this with the understanding that it will likely change.

I added a fifth year to the plan because, even with my thirty-nine transfer credits, five of the next seven semesters have over eighteen credits. I earned my MUS Core certificate to check off the general education requirements specifically so I wouldn’t have to take more than fifteen credits per semester. I would rather uphold this plan than cram more credits in per semester, as this works better with how my brain operates.

### Academic Narrative

The goal of this short essay was to think of the long-term goals of one’s education and life and to discuss how those can be achieved. I began with a short retrospective of my education, then transitioned to my dreams and goals.

### "I Am From" Poem

The goal of this poem was to focus on what makes each individual person themselves. I wrote about coming from family food traditions, odd passions, and growth.

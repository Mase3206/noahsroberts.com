The Franke Global Leadership Initiative ([GLI](https://www.umt.edu/global-leadership-initiative/)) is a four-year certificate program at the University of Montana that focuses on global issues and challenges that may go unnoticed by the general populous. Students are challenged to address some of these issues through various seminars and a semester abroad, culminating in a Senior Capstone project. Because most GLI students are also in the [DHC](/education/dhc), the GLI Senior Capstone is also accepted by the DHC.

### And then, it was over.

This is the Module 2 reflection for GBLD 220: Models of Leadership. This three-week module was hosted by [Michael Rohd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-rohd-7605b1266) and focused on the importance of listening and collaboration for successful leadership. We were asked to pick an image or quote from the module and explain how that quote relates to the theme of the module and the idea of leadership overall. I wrote about a series of events still sensitive to me that occurred a few years ago, as this module offered a partial explanation to why they happened.

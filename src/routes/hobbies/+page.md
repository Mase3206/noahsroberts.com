I have been a member of my fair share of extracurriculars, mainly Scouts, theatre, and music. Scouts gave me purpose, and theatre gave me community. I also do a little coding on the side.

I began my [Scouting](/hobbies/scouts) career in first grade when I joined Pack 1 and continued as I crossed over into Troop 1. I remained with the troop for over seven years and held six unique leadership positions. I earned Eagle Scout in September of 2022.

I joined [theatre](/hobbies/theatre) mainly because all my friends were doing it. Along the way, I learned the rules and leadership structure of the stage. I began as a light operator (and pseudo-designer apprentice) in late 2021. I then shifted into a sound operator role in late 2022, which I continued until graduation. I eventually became the sound designer for Joseph and unofficially took on the role of sound engineer for The Adding Machine as well.

It turns out that “coding on the side” would lead me down the path I am on, seeking a degree in Computer Science. I tell that story in more detail on the [Code](/hobbies/code) page.

I also have a very musical life. I played piano as a child, switching to cello in fifth grade, which I played for seven years. Though I have never been a member of a choir, I joined my university’s a cappella group after a close friend of mine recruited me.

I am also a [homelabber](/hobbies/homelab)! I run a small Proxmox cluster serving a variety of things with varying usefulness.

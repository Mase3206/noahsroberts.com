I have been using a computer since I could talk — playing TuxPaint and *Clifford the Big Red Dog* on a 17-inch iMac G4… oh I miss those days. My love for technology eventually developed into my role as the unofficial tech support for my teachers throughout all my years of school. In sixth grade, my uncle gave me a Learn to Code: Python book.

Little did he know that that book would set the course for the rest of my life.

Within four years, I became fairly confident in my coding abilities. I had branched out to a few other languages as well, like HTML and a pinch of Java. Over the next two years, I shifted my focus back to Python, honing in the skills I understood and working on those which I did not. By the beginning of my first year of college, I felt confident enough to publish my first complete application for everyone to see.

Below is a selection of the code I am most proud of, with my first public package at the top. My code uses [version 3 of the GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) (GPLv3), unless otherwise stated.

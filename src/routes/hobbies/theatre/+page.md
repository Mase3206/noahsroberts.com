Over the course of a few months, I worked closely with my director, [Bridger Lutz](https://shanebridgerlutz.wixsite.com/shanelutz), to create the acoustic aesthetic he envisioned. This included pulling sounds from royalty-free sound banks as well as making my own sounds if what we needed did not yet exist. With the help of QLab 5, I used over sixty unique sound files, including three homemade tracks, amounting to almost half a gigabyte of compressed and uncompressed audio to run the show.

This was the first show where I was not afraid to shy away from my previous philosophy of simplicity a bit. I progressively added more and more elements to the show to push me out of my comfort zone and make it that much more impactful.

I was training another student to take my place at the time, so I put him in charge of operating the sound during the show.

Samples of this project are available upon request. Visit the [Resume](/resume) page for my contact information.

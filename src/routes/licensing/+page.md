I take licensing seriously. I prefer open licenses for most original work, but the typical licenses used for each kind of work can vary.

## Code

All of my original code uses version 3 of the GNU Public License, or [GPL-3](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-gpl-3), unless otherwise stated. Regardless of license, all code I share here will be open source. [TL;DR Legal](https://www.tldrlegal.com/) has explanations of the most common open source licenses for the non-lawyers out there.

## Creative Works

I classify anything that isn’t code — such as writing, audio, visuals, etc. — as “creative works.” All original creative works use [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), unless otherwise stated.

The first release of my side project, grog (formerly known as HandBrake AutoTranscode), is out! It still is lacking in a fair amount of features, like parsing of certain filter options, or parsing of any subtitle tracks, but I need more time before I can work on those. Because of this, it was numbered v0.1.0, because it is functional but not fully featured. [Release v0.1.0 can be found here](https://github.com/Mase3206/grog/releases/tag/v0.1.0), and the whole repository can be found below.

This program grabs information from various YAML files and one CSV file and sends a command to HandBrakeCLI based on that information to rip specified titles off of disk images. It is designed specifically to speed up the ripping of TV show collector’s editions on DVDs or Blu-Rays.

Currently, the only releases available are for Windows, because that’s what I use for transcoding (go NVENC!), but I will be publishing releases for other platforms once I have more time… and once this is more complete. However, because it’s just Python 3 source, it will run on whatever platform can run both HandBrakeCLI and Python.
